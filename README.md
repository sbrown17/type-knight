# type-knight
An ambitious type checker and linter for JavaScript to make sure code is as type safe and immutable as possible.
---
## Objectives:
- [ ] warn when variables are intialized without a type
	- [ ] ignore commented vars
- [ ] warn when variables aren't kept within the function or block that they are intialized in
- [ ] warn when using double equals instead of triple (keep them using hard checks instead of introducing type coercion
- [ ] warn when variables are mutated
	- [ ] give suggestions on when they can be kept const
- [ ] give suggestions on how to solve these problems when encountered
